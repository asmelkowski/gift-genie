### Frontend — React Coding Standards
- Use functional components with hooks (no classes).
- Use `React.memo` for expensive components with stable props.
- Code‑split via `React.lazy` and `<Suspense>`.
- Use `useCallback` for handlers passed to children to avoid re‑renders.
- Use `useMemo` for expensive computations.
- Use `useId` for accessible unique IDs.
- Use `useTransition` for non‑urgent state updates.
