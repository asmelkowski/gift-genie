### Frontend — Zustand
- Create separate stores per state domain.
- Use `immer` middleware for complex immutable updates.
- Implement selectors to derive state and avoid re‑renders.
- Persist with `persist` middleware when appropriate.
- Use strict TypeScript typing for store definitions.
- Prefer shallow equality checks with `useShallow` for perf.
- Compose stores to share logic.
- Use subscriptions for state changes outside React.
- Enable devtools middleware in development.
- Wrap access in custom hooks.
