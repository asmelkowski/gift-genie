# Things to do
-  Finalizing a draw should also add assignments to historical exclusions
- historical exclusions should have a reference to a draw that created them in order to be able to only that into account those exclusions that match the lookback criteria.
- draw could have a unique name so that it's easy to distinguish which draw is which. That name can also be used in notify templates.
- fix not working dark theme (button is there, but does nothing)
