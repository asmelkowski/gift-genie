# Gift Genie Database Schema

## 1. Tables

### 1.1 users
Application users who create and manage groups.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| id | UUID | PRIMARY KEY | Auto-generated UUID (uuid_generate_v4()) |
| email | TEXT | NOT NULL | User's email address (case-insensitive uniqueness via index) |
| password_hash | TEXT | NOT NULL | Bcrypt hashed password |
| name | TEXT | NOT NULL | User's display name |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | Account creation timestamp |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | Last update timestamp (auto-updated via trigger) |

**Notes:**
- Email uniqueness enforced via unique index on LOWER(email)
- Password validation handled at application layer
- JWT tokens used for authentication (stateless, no sessions table)

### 1.2 groups
Gift exchange groups managed by users.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| id | UUID | PRIMARY KEY | Auto-generated UUID (uuid_generate_v4()) |
| admin_user_id | UUID | NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE | Group owner/admin |
| name | TEXT | NOT NULL | Group name |
| historical_exclusions_enabled | BOOLEAN | NOT NULL DEFAULT true | Enable automatic exclusions based on past draws |
| historical_exclusions_lookback | INTEGER | NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 | Number of previous draws to consider for exclusions |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | Group creation timestamp |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | Last update timestamp (auto-updated via trigger) |

**Notes:**
- Single admin per group (no multi-admin support in MVP)
- Historical exclusion settings stored directly on group
- Lookback count represents number of previous finalized draws to check
- Deleting a user cascades to delete all their groups

### 1.3 members
Participants within gift exchange groups.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| id | UUID | PRIMARY KEY | Auto-generated UUID (uuid_generate_v4()) |
| group_id | UUID | NOT NULL REFERENCES groups(id) ON DELETE CASCADE | Parent group |
| name | TEXT | NOT NULL | Member's name (must be unique within group context) |
| email | TEXT | NULL | Optional email for notifications (case-insensitive uniqueness per group) |
| is_active | BOOLEAN | NOT NULL DEFAULT true | Active status for participation in draws |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | Member creation timestamp |

**Constraints:**
- UNIQUE (group_id, LOWER(email)) WHERE email IS NOT NULL

**Notes:**
- Members are lightweight entities separate from app users
- Email is optional but recommended for notifications
- Name uniqueness enforced at application layer (business logic)
- Inactive members excluded from draws without deletion
- Deleting a group cascades to delete all its members

### 1.4 exclusions
Rules preventing specific member pairings in draws.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| id | UUID | PRIMARY KEY | Auto-generated UUID (uuid_generate_v4()) |
| group_id | UUID | NOT NULL REFERENCES groups(id) ON DELETE CASCADE | Parent group |
| giver_member_id | UUID | NOT NULL REFERENCES members(id) ON DELETE CASCADE | Member who cannot give to receiver |
| receiver_member_id | UUID | NOT NULL REFERENCES members(id) ON DELETE CASCADE | Member who cannot receive from giver |
| exclusion_type | exclusion_type_enum | NOT NULL | Type: 'manual' or 'historical' |
| is_mutual | BOOLEAN | NOT NULL DEFAULT false | If true, exclusion applies in both directions |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | Exclusion creation timestamp |
| created_by_user_id | UUID | NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL | User who created the exclusion (null for system-generated) |

**Notes:**
- Each exclusion direction stored as separate row
- Historical exclusions automatically created by domain layer based on past N draws
- For mutual exclusions, both directions are stored with is_mutual flag
- Self-exclusions (giver = receiver) implicitly enforced, not stored
- Deleting a member cascades to delete their exclusions

### 1.5 draws
Draw instances for groups (pending or finalized).

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| id | UUID | PRIMARY KEY | Auto-generated UUID (uuid_generate_v4()) |
| group_id | UUID | NOT NULL REFERENCES groups(id) ON DELETE CASCADE | Parent group |
| status | draw_status_enum | NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' | Draw status: 'pending' or 'finalized' |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | Draw creation timestamp |
| finalized_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | NULL | Timestamp when draw was finalized |
| notification_sent_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | NULL | Timestamp when email notifications were sent |

**Notes:**
- Multiple pending draws allowed per group (no unique constraint)
- Finalized draws are immutable (cannot be modified or deleted) - enforced in domain layer
- Pending draws can be hard deleted
- Each finalized draw triggers new email notifications
- Historical exclusions calculated from finalized draws only
- Deleting a group cascades to delete all its draws

### 1.6 assignments
Individual giver-receiver pairings within a draw.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| id | UUID | PRIMARY KEY | Auto-generated UUID (uuid_generate_v4()) |

| encrypted_receiver_id | TEXT | NULL | Encrypted receiver ID for future anonymous mode (post-MVP) |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | Assignment creation timestamp |

**Constraints:**
- UNIQUE (draw_id, giver_member_id)
- CHECK (giver_member_id != receiver_member_id)

**Notes:**
- Each member gives to exactly one person per draw (enforced by unique constraint)
- Self-assignment prevented by CHECK constraint
- encrypted_receiver_id prepared for post-MVP anonymous mode feature
- Deleting a draw cascades to delete all its assignments

CREATE TYPE draw_status_enum AS ENUM ('pending', 'finalized');
```

**Values:**
- `pending`: Draw is in progress, can be edited or deleted
- `finalized`: Draw is locked and immutable, used for historical exclusions

### 3.2 exclusion_type_enum
```sql
CREATE TYPE exclusion_type_enum AS ENUM ('manual', 'historical');
```

**Values:**
- `manual`: User-created exclusion rule (e.g., spouse, parent-child)

## 4. Indexes

### 4.1 Primary Key Indexes
All tables have primary key indexes on `id` column (UUID) - automatically created.

### 4.2 Foreign Key Indexes
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_groups_admin_user_id ON groups(admin_user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_members_group_id ON members(group_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_exclusions_group_id ON exclusions(group_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_exclusions_giver_member_id ON exclusions(giver_member_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_exclusions_receiver_member_id ON exclusions(receiver_member_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_exclusions_created_by_user_id ON exclusions(created_by_user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_draws_group_id ON draws(group_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_assignments_draw_id ON assignments(draw_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_assignments_giver_member_id ON assignments(giver_member_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_assignments_receiver_member_id ON assignments(receiver_member_id);
```

### 4.3 Unique Indexes
```sql

CREATE INDEX idx_draws_group_status ON draws(group_id, status);
```

### 4.5 Partial Indexes
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_members_group_active ON members(group_id) WHERE is_active = true;
```

## 5. Triggers

### 5.1 Updated At Triggers

Automatically update `updated_at` timestamp on record modification.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER update_users_updated_at
    BEFORE UPDATE ON users
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();

CREATE TRIGGER update_groups_updated_at
    BEFORE UPDATE ON groups
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();
```

## 6. PostgreSQL Policies (Row-Level Security)

**RLS is NOT implemented for MVP.** Security and access control are enforced in the domain and application layers:

- User authentication via JWT tokens
- Authorization checks in use cases before data access
- Business rule validation in domain entities
- Admin-only access to group management enforced in API layer

**Rationale for deferring RLS:**
- Simpler implementation and debugging
- Adequate security for MVP scope
- Application-layer enforcement provides flexibility
- Can be added post-MVP if stricter database-level security needed

## 7. Design Decisions and Notes

### 7.1 UUID Primary Keys
- All tables use UUID primary keys (uuid_generate_v4())
- Prevents enumeration attacks on API endpoints
- No sequential ID guessing
- Better for distributed systems and data portability

### 7.2 Case-Insensitive Email Handling
- Users table: Unique index on LOWER(email) prevents "user@example.com" and "User@Example.com"
- Members table: Composite unique index on (group_id, LOWER(email)) prevents duplicates per group
- Authentication queries use LOWER(email) for case-insensitive matching

### 7.3 Exclusion Storage Model
- Each exclusion direction stored as separate row
- `is_mutual` flag indicates two-way exclusions
- Allows efficient querying: "who can't X give to?" → single direction lookup
- Historical exclusions automatically created by domain layer after draw finalization
- `exclusion_type` distinguishes manual vs system-generated rules

### 7.4 Historical Exclusions Logic
- Settings stored on groups table: `historical_exclusions_enabled`, `historical_exclusions_lookback`
- Lookback count = number of previous finalized draws to check
- Calculated in domain layer, not database functions
- If member wasn't in a previous draw, no exclusions from that draw apply
- Flexible for groups with varying draw frequencies

### 7.5 Draw Immutability
- Finalized draws cannot be modified or deleted (enforced in domain layer)
- `finalized_at` timestamp marks the point of immutability
- Pending draws can be hard deleted (no soft delete mechanism)
- All finalized draws contribute to historical exclusions
- If changes needed after finalization, admin creates new draw

### 7.6 Multiple Draws Per Group
- No unique constraint on pending draws per group
- Multiple finalized draws can coexist (multi-year history)
- Each draw independent with its own assignments
- Draw history tracked via timestamps (created_at, finalized_at)

### 7.7 Cascade Deletion Strategy
- All foreign keys use ON DELETE CASCADE (except created_by_user_id which uses SET NULL)
- Ensures complete data removal when user deletes account
- Prevents orphaned records
- Groups, members, exclusions, draws, and assignments all cascade appropriately

### 7.8 Anonymous Mode Preparation
- `encrypted_receiver_id` column in assignments table (nullable, TEXT)
- Reserved for post-MVP anonymous mode feature
- Will use simplest available encryption method
- Currently unused in MVP (assignments visible to admin)

### 7.9 Notification Tracking
- `notification_sent_at` timestamp on draws table
- Sufficient for MVP (tracks if/when notifications sent)
- No separate email log table needed
- Can be extended post-MVP if detailed delivery tracking required

### 7.10 Authentication Strategy
- Stateless JWT tokens (no sessions table)
- Password hashing with bcrypt (stored in password_hash column)
- Password validation rules enforced at application layer
- Token expiration and refresh handled in application code

### 7.11 Business Rules Validation
Enforced in domain/application layers, not database:
- Minimum 3 active members required for draw
- Name uniqueness within group
- Valid draw configurations (exclusions don't make draw impossible)
- Member active status changes restricted when part of pending draws
- Finalized draw immutability

### 7.12 Migration Management
- All schema changes managed via Alembic
- Version-controlled migrations in `backend/src/gift_genie/infrastructure/database/migrations/`
- Alembic commands: `alembic revision --autogenerate`, `alembic upgrade head`, `alembic downgrade`
- Initial migration includes all tables, enums, indexes, triggers

### 7.13 Performance Considerations
- Expected group sizes: 4-50 members
- Draw algorithm complexity: O(n²) for exclusion checking
- Standard PostgreSQL features adequate for MVP scale
- Comprehensive indexing strategy for common query patterns
- Partial index on active members optimizes draw preparation queries
- Composite index on (group_id, status) optimizes draw filtering

### 7.14 Data Integrity Constraints
Minimal database-level constraints (most validation in domain layer):
- NOT NULL on required fields
- UNIQUE constraints on (draw_id, giver_member_id) - each member gives once per draw
- CHECK constraint preventing self-assignments: giver_member_id != receiver_member_id
- Foreign key constraints with CASCADE deletion
- Case-insensitive email uniqueness via functional indexes

### 7.15 Timestamp Strategy
- `created_at`: All tables (immutable, set on insert)
- `updated_at`: Users and groups (auto-updated via trigger)
- `finalized_at`: Draws (set when status changes to 'finalized')
- `notification_sent_at`: Draws (set when emails sent)
- All timestamps use TIMESTAMPTZ (timezone-aware)
